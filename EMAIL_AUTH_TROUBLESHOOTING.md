# 🔐 GMAIL AUTHENTICATION ERROR - TROUBLESHOOTING

## ❌ What Happened

Gmail rejected the password: `Tabbs#2002.&`

```
Error: Username and Password not accepted
https://support.google.com/mail/?p=BadCredentials
```

## ✅ How to Fix

The password you provided might not be a **Gmail App Password**. Gmail App Passwords are different from your regular Gmail password.

### Important Note:
- **Regular Gmail Password** = Your normal login password for Gmail (❌ Won't work)
- **Gmail App Password** = Special 16-character password generated by Google (✅ Works)

## 📋 Required Setup Steps

### Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification (if not done)

1. Go to **https://myaccount.google.com/**
2. Click **"Security"** on the left sidebar
3. Find **"2-Step Verification"**
4. Click **"Get Started"** if not already enabled
5. Complete the verification process

### Step 2: Generate Gmail App Password

1. Go to **https://myaccount.google.com/**
2. Click **"Security"** on the left sidebar  
3. Scroll down to **"App passwords"**
4. Select:
   - **App**: Mail
   - **Device**: Windows Computer
5. Click **"Generate"**
6. Google will show a **16-character password** like:
   ```
   a1b2 c3d4 e5f6 g7h8
   ```

### Step 3: Copy the Password

The App Password will look similar to this (Google generates it):
```
wxyz abcd efgh ijkl
```

**Copy just the characters (ignore spaces)**

### Step 4: Update .env File

Open `.env` and update:
```env
MAIL_PASSWORD=wxyzabcdefghijkl
```

Replace with your actual 16-character password from Google.
