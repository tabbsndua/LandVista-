## 💡 BEST PRACTICES

### 1. Add Client Info Immediately
When someone inquires about a property:
- Don't wait - add them to your system right away
- Include all contact details
- Note which property they're interested in
- Set their budget if mentioned

### 2. Update Status Regularly
- Mark as "Pending" if waiting for their decision
- Change to "Inactive" if no contact for 30+ days
- Move to "Active" when they're seriously considering

### 3. Use Notes Strategically
**Good Notes:**
- "Interested in 2-acre properties near water"
- "Investor looking for rental income potential"
- "Needs mortgage financing assistance"
- "Follow up after loan approval in March"

**Not Helpful:**
- "Good person"
- "Maybe interested"
- (blank)

### 4. Regular Follow-Up
- Check your Active/Pending clients weekly
- Send relevant property updates
- A client added 6 months ago might be ready now!
- One follow-up converts many lost sales

### 5. Link Clients to Inquiries
If a client submitted an inquiry on your website:
- Note it in the Notes field
- Mark their status
- Know their property history
